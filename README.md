This repository contains 4 main files the are needed to run the program.
Those are PrintHeader.cpp, PriorityQueue.h, header.h, and main.cpp. There
is also the .gitignore file, this README.md, and the StyleGuide.odt which 
we used as a guide for commenting the code. This code is in C++ and was 
initially made using Eclipse.
